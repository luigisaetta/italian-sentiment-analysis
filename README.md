This repository contains all the artifacts originally developed for a demo where I have developed a model for **Sentiment Analysis in Italian**

Then, I have added a second examples using a multi-lingual model (English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian)

all the to models used are based on BERT

## features
* How to use a pretrained **Transformer** for Sentiment Analysis
* how to save a model to a local directory and load from the local directory


## further ideas
* Language detection

## credits
The first pretrained model was developed by **Neuraly**.
