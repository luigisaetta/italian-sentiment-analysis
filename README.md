# Italian-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains all the artifacts originally developed for a demo where I have developed a model for **Sentiment Analysis in Italian**

Then, I have added a second examples using a multi-lingual model (English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian)

## features
* How to use a pretrained **Transformer** for Sentiment Analysis


## further ideas
* Language detection
